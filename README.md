# Hand Gesture Recognition using MediaPipe and Machine Learning

This project is developed as part of my internship with **Prodigy Infotech**. It allows real-time **hand gesture recognition** using webcam input, powered by **MediaPipe**, **OpenCV**, and **scikit-learn**.

# Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:
- Collect hand landmark data using webcam
- Train a machine learning model on custom gestures
- Recognize and classify gestures in real-time
